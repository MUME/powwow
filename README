COMPILING

	Try the shell-script 'make_it', ie type './make_it'.
	If that doesn't	work, read the file 'Compile.how', try to edit
	the 'Makefile' manually and either run './make_it' or 'make'.
	If you have to edit the Makefile, or edit the source
	code, to get it to work, pleae e-mail any changes you did to:
	<max@Linuz.sns.it>. Also include info on what system you have
	(type 'uname -a' to get the necessary info).

	You may also want to edit the Makefile in order to fine-tune powwow
	to your system (change optimizations, include regexp library, etc.)

INSTALLING

	If you want powwow's definition files to go in a specific directory,
	set the environment variable POWWOWDIR to that directory. It will be
	searched first for definition files at startup.
	
	Put the file powwow.6 in a suitable directory if you want users on
	your system to be able to read the long and comprehensive man page ;)

	Powwow supports the MUME editing protocol.  It enables you to edit
	texts locally with your favourite editor.  So far, only MUME supports
	this protocol, but this might change in the future.

	Powwow looks for the editor in the POWWOWEDITOR enviroment variable,
	and if it doesn't exist, in EDITOR, and uses "emacs" as default.  For
	text viewing, powwow looks for POWWOWPAGER, then PAGER, then uses
	"more" as default.

	If you are on a multi-window terminal (such as an X terminal or NCSA
	telnet from a Mac or PC), powwow will let you start the editor in
	another window and remain active.  You will then also be able to edit
	several texts at the same time.  To achieve this, let the first
	character of your editor/pager be '&' (which is then skipped).

	Example: (Bourne shell syntax)
	
	POWWOWEDITOR=vi		  Use vi as normal editor (same window as
				  powwow)
	POWWOWEDITOR='&emacs'	  Use emacs as editor in a separate window (if
				  you are on an X terminal)
	POWWOWEDITOR='&xterm -e vi'  Use vi in another X window
	POWWOWPAGER='&xterm -e less' Use less as your file viewer in another
				     X window

	If you use a multi-window terminal and have emacsclient installed, it
	is a good choice, since you only need one emacs window for all your
	editing sessions and you don't have to start and exit emacs all the
	time.  Set POWWOWEDITOR='&emacsclient' in that case, and make sure your
	emacs has a running server (put (server-start) in your .emacs file or
	type M-x server-start).

	If you want to use the editing functions, you must execute the
	"#identify" command to notify the server that the client supports the
	protocol. This can also be done with an action; see the documentation
	for details.

	For editing Mudlle programs with emacs, there is a special mode that
	helps you with indenting. To use it, put mudlle.el in a suitable
	place, and add the two following lines to your .emacs file:

	(setq load-path (append load-path '("mydirectory")))
	(autoload 'mudlle-mode "mudlle.el" "Turns on mudlle editing mode" t)

	where you replace mydirectory with the directory where mudlle.el can
	be found. If you put the string -*-mudlle-*- in the first line of
	a mudlle program (i.e. in a comment), then emacs will automatically
	turn on mudlle mode for that file when you edit it.
	The mudlle mode can be customized to some extent. See the source for
	details.

BUGS

	If you have any problems with powwow, try to fix them yourself
	(you have the source, right?) or at least isolate the bugs so
	the maintainer has a fair change of fixing them. Don't expect
	a bug to be fixed, unless you explain it in detail (expecially
	how to reproduce it) and supply the powwow and OS version,
	as well as the compilation options. 
        Suggestions for improvements are also very welcome.
