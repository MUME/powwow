From the authors of cancan:

    THINGS TO DO
	  Cancan should know the codes of at least some keys
	  by looking in the TERMCAP. (especially control keys are trivial!)

	- Run (a)lint!

	- There seems to be problems with running cancan on exotic terminals.
	  This defeats the very purpose of all the carefully terminal-
	  independent code with TERMCAP, and is generally embarrassing.

	- more system calls should be checked for EINTR for sysV unices

	- negotiate the telnet BINARY option

	- support the telnet IAC GA command to identify prompts
	  (But what for? Prompts have to be identified as such in the absence
	   of GA anyway, and there doesn't seem to be a need for it right
	   now.)

	- implement reverse-incremental-search (like ^R in GNU Readline)

    KNOWN BUGS
	- Deleting more than one character with deletechar() might leave
	  ugly traces on lines that are entirely deleted.

	- using #hilite with coloured background might have effects beyond the
	  input line, depending on the terminal (don't do that, then :-)

    FUTURE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
	Do some more for portability (clean up the terminal mess)
	The source should be more modular
	Filtering output through shell command (grep etc)


THINGS TO DO/PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS on powwow:
       - make a better #help
       - add termcap `end of bold', `end of blink' etc.
       
       If you have ideas, suggestions or whatever, e-mail them to me
       (max@Linuz.sns.it) and if I find them interesting, I will add them.
       Also, I am trying to keep powwow updated with further releases
       of cancan.
