	* powwow.6: Supprt automatically converting man page to different
	  encodings by setting MAN_PAGE_ENCODING when running
	  configure. Defaults to UTF-8 on all hosts except OS X (darwin),
	  where it is ISO-8859-1.
	* build: Fixed build out of the box on OS X by turning on
	  --enable-bsd by default on darwin hosts.
	* cmd2.c: Fixed some problems related to binding keys with the
	  high bit set.

2008-12-29        dain

	  instead of just line wrapping
	* cmd.c: Don't try and load non-.so files in cmd_module

2007-03-08 06:30  bpk

	* ptr.c, ptr.h: This should again fix the double-free bug that was
	  once fixed in perlwow

2006-12-07 22:12  bpk

	* debian/changelog, debian/control: Fixed version numbers

2006-11-08 17:12  bpk

2006-03-24 23:49  bpk

	* cmd2.c, defines.h, follow.c, list.c, main.c: Removed malloc.h
	  since it's obsolete, fixed follow.c to not use tty_read_fd since
	  it looks like a copy-paste job that didn't get fixed and causes
	  brokenness on bsd

	  to create variables with illegal names. bug #2: Expressions like
	  "-30" or "+5" were incorrectly interpretted as named variables
	  which were then completely inaccessible. bug #3: Deletion of
	  existing named variable via #var $(expression)= caused crash.
	  (pointer to var-node was not set) (Elestir)

	* cmd.c: Better handling of line continuation (Elestir)

2006-01-31 21:55  bpk

	* main.c: 1. Allows empty-line matching using regexp. E.g.:

	  matched regex params after finding an empty match (Elestir)

2006-01-31 21:50  bpk

	  by Dain

2005-11-22 16:53  bpk

	* cmd2.c: Fix for segfault when viewing a single alias from Kalev
	  Lember <kalev@smartlink.ee> #alias foo=bar #alias foo Caused
	  segfault

2005-11-13 08:55  bpk

	* dist-info.cf: This is the new config for mkdist

2005-10-27 06:11  bpk

	* eval.c: This fixes a tiny memory leak caused by not freeing the
	  copy of a variable if used in a comparison on the left side,

	  #print Dwarves

2005-10-21 23:20  bpk

	* tcp.c: Added some casts because byte is unsigned char and some
	  functions in main wanted to have signed chars, this was the
	  previous behaviour but the compiler spit out warnings, now it
	  shouldn't anymore.

2005-09-16 19:12  bpk

	* README.modules: A rough overview of module support

2005-03-21 21:35  bpk

	  cmd.c, cmd2.c, configure, defines.h, eval.c, list.c, log.c,
	  main.c, movie.c, ptr.h, tcp.c, tty.c, utils.c: Convert all `' to
	  "" as per the powwow-1.2.6-dain patch. Note I did not apply the
	  patch since 1.2.7 has some differences to 1.2.5 with regard to
	  command handling and things, so I'm applying the diff parts by
	  hand mostly

2005-03-21 18:16  bpk

	* cmd.c: Don't include dlfcn.h if no libdl

2005-03-21 18:13  bpk

	* cmd.c: Do not include #module support if there is no libdl

2005-03-13 02:18  bpk

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4: Updated to include the
	  debian build files in the make dist, also regenerated some of
	  the automake/conf stuff

2005-03-12 05:05  bpk

	* cmd.c, ptr.h: Made #module print messages prefixed with #module
	  instead of #lib, also display the path to the library that was
	  loaded so that if testing new libraries you can tell which one
	  was found :p

2005-03-12 02:43  bpk

	* cmd.c, ptr.h: Changed #module to not require the .so extension,
	  and added some checks for _GNU_SOURCE in ptr.h so that modules
	  compiled with GNU externsions will work with powwow.h (like perl)

2005-03-12 00:41  bpk

	* cmd.c: Changed the #module command to handle searching multiple
	  (currently compiled in) library paths, and remove the
	  requirement for the .so part of the filename so that in future
	  versions we can support .dll under cygwin

	ignored, would be nice to kill to end of line though

2004-07-01 10:54  bpk

	* Initial import of stock powwow 1.2.5

Changes from 1.2.4 to 1.2.5 (Massimiliano Ghilardi, ...) 21 Jan 2002
 	* Added append-mode to #capture: use #capture >file-name
	* Cleaned #spawned commands interface: text they print on
	  standard output *MUST* terminate with a newline ('\n')
	  in order for powwow to execute it.
 	* Fixed missing #include <time.h> in main.h.
 	* Fixed broken matching of #mark patterns starting with $
	* Added the following user-contributed patches:
	  * Put also 1-char lines into history;
	  * Do not capture/movie data coming from spawned commands;
	  * Fixed a bug in command parser.
	
Changes from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 24 May 2000
	* Added support for IAC GA as end-of-prompt marker.
	* Added #request [prompt][editor][all]
	* Fixed missing/slow prompt redrawing under some circumstances
	  if #isprompt <number> was used.
	
Changes from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 18 Jan 2000
	* Fixed `#spawn' command that was completely screwed up.
	  Also fixed CTRL-C not to kill spawned commands.
	* Sending/receiving data to/from spawned commands erased the prompt
	  instead of reprinting it. Fixed.
	  (If you don't like powwow to show the prompt before executing
	  lines from spawned commands, set #option +compact)

Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 10 May 1999
	* Fixed `#delim custom' to accept whatever character as delimiters.
	  Previously stopped before the first word-delimiting char (argh!)
	* Fixed screen corruption when doing some editing functions
	  (&del-word-right, &del-word-left, &complete-word, &complete-line,
	  parentheses flashing) while data comes from the MUD.
	* Fixed a line redrawing bug when inserting chars on terminals
	  with VT100-like wrapglitch.
	* Fixed SEGFAULT on #send, #emulate, #exe of a numeric expression.
	* Fixed stupid SEGFAULT when cancelling an editing session.
	* Fixed sending/receiving latin-1 '\377' (ASCII char 255) as IAC IAC
	  to conform telnet protocol, both directly and inside MPI messages.
	* Fixed matching #actions, #prompts and #marks on MUD data splitted
	  into multiple fragments.
	* Fixed line length calculation when receiving '\r' in the middle
	  of a line.
	* Fixed extra prompt redrawing in #option +compact mode.
	* Added #option sendsize and #option autoclear.
	  Changed default not to send window size upon connecting.
	  (if the MUD asks it, the window size is sent anyway)
	  Use #option +sendsize to automatically send it when you connect.
	* Added command #rawsend.
	* Removed bits of ANSI code giving problems
	  with really picky non-ANSI compilers
	  
Changes from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 20 Nov 1998
	* Fixed a typo in Makefile.
	* Reversed order of saved #history lines.
	* Fixed out-of-bound array accesses in tcp_find() and tcp_show()
	  which could give SEGFAULT on #connect, #snoop and #zap.
	* Fixed buggy loop in saving #history in definition file that could
	  create a huge temporary file, filling the filesystem.
	* Fixed sporadic SEGFAULT when hitting backspace and some other
	  editing keys.
	* Math operator `?' could freeze due to buggy code.
	  Systems providing GNU memmem() didn't experience the problem
	  as it was used instead of my replacement code.
	* Enhanced support for terminals with VT100-like wrapglitch:
	  on them, the rightmost character of every line is used too.
	* Fixed wrapping in #printing strings containing ASCII chars > 127
	  when #option wrap is on.
	* Fixed incorrect drawing of prompt and command line under some
	  circumstances.
	* Fixed wrong wrapping of lines immediately after the prompt
	  in #option +wrap mode.
	* Removed extra newlines sent after each line in `#send <filename'
	  and `send !command'.
	* Fixed a few off-by-one errors causing corruption in #movie/#capture
	  and (reprint) buffers.
	* Powwow now discards all \r received immediately before or after \n,
	  to avoid troubles when strange data comes just before the prompt.
	* Changed MPI key to `unsigned int' because MUME uses a 32 bit
	  unsigned value for it.
	* Cleaned up remote file editing not to leave stale files in /tmp.
	* Cleaned up multiple connections support:
	  Fixed spurious `#too many open connections' errors.
	  Fixed prompt drawing glitches when getting data from subsidiary
	  connections.

Changes from 1.1.7 to 1.2.0 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 05 Oct 1998
	* Copyright change. Powwow is now GPL-ed.
	* Version number bump. I hope there aren't many bugs left.
	  If you are coming from 1.0.x versions, read this file and powwow.doc
	  carefully, many things have changed!
	* Fixed double-newline printing after each line if #option +wrap
	  was set.
	* Suppressed useless reprinting of files sent back to MUD
	  using MUME remote editing protocol.
	* Updated a few details in docs.
	* Some old compilers choked on bits of ANSI code. Fixed.
	* Fixed extra newline after prompt in #movie and #capture
	  when #setvar buffer is not zero.
	* Fixed extra \r at beginning of a line under rare circumstances.
	* #delim now unescapes the custom delimeters.
	* Added missing close() when remote host closes connection.
	* Rewrote the code to merge lines received in two (or more) fragments.
	* Added `#help warranty' and `#help copyright' to conform GPL :-/

Changes from 1.1.6 to 1.1.7 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 15 Sep 1998
	* Changed meaning and effect of #prompt and #isprompt.
	  If you used them, re-read their docs in powwow.doc!
	* Alias names containing spaces are now rejected too.
	  Relaxed rules a little, unbalanced () {} or ""
	  now just print a warning instead of causing an error.
	* Added #option reprint.
	* Old #prompts were not removed on #load. fixed.
	* Fixed SEGFAULT when chaining very long strings:
	  #("foo..." + "bar...")
	* Fixed small compiling problems on some platforms.
	* Fixed an off-by-one error in math operator >:
	* Fixed math operator `=' bug on copying empty strings.
	* Fixed a crashy bug in #reset var.
	* Fixed some quirks in unescaping strings:
	  ending backslashes caused SEGFAULT,
	  sequences like \\\``` were unescaped incorrectly.
	* Fixed incorrect code in #mark and #action that
	  mismatched patterns containing two or more wildcards.
	
Changes from 1.1.5 to 1.1.6 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 03 Sep 1998
	* Added circular backbuffer for #capture and #movie.
	  Can be enabled/disabled/resized with #setvar buffer.
	* Sanitized aliases: powwow now rejects alias names containing
	  unbalanced special chars ""(){} . Example:
	  #alias (=#print   is illegal, while
	  #alias "("=#print is ok.
	  #alias {}=#print  is ok,
	  #alias \\{=#print is ok too as it matches \{ and _not_ {
	* Removed a redundant alias unescaping. If #alias foo=\\bar
	  then `foo' now sends `\bar' instead of `bar'.
	* Fixed a compatibility problem when reading #binds of new savefiles
	  using old versions of powwow.
	* Fixed some problems with #var on numbered variables.
	* Fixed #internal error, selflookup_sortednode() failed!
	  that affected 1.1.5
	* Fixed SEGFAULT upon #exe \; (introduced in 1.1.5).
	* When getting data from the MUD after a prompt which set #isprompt
	  the data is now printed as a separate line even if it doesn't start
	  with a newline. Helps turning things like
	      * HP:Fine>You hit the wolf's head hard.
	  into
	      * HP:Fine>
	      You hit the wolf's head hard.
	  Anyway, such data has _always_ been considered separate
	  from the prompt if it set #isprompt, i.e. #action patterns like
	  "^You hit the wolf" already worked in the above case.
	  
Changes from 1.1.4 to 1.1.5 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 30 Aug 1998
	* Massive code cleanup.
	* Finished removing size limits on strings, text lines and variables.
	* Renamed `#settimer' as `#setvar timer' and `#lines' as `#setvar lines'
	  Added `#setvar mem' to set/edit/remove length limit on text/strings.
	* Powwow now stops command execution after any error.
	* #key now works also with editing keys.
	* Added #keyedit command. "#keyedit &prev-line" runs
	  the editing function `&prev-line' and so on.
	* Added "&insert-string <string>" editing function.
	* Added #mark ^pattern, which matches only at line start.
	* Decreased CPU usage when/after a lot of variables, aliases or marks
	  are created.
	* Added `*' and `*=' math operator for strings.
	* Fixed math operators ^^=, ||= and &&= to always return 0 or 1.
	* Fixed SEGFAULT when creating more than 100 variables.
	  (bug introduced in 1.1.0)
	* Fixed SEGFAULT when realloc()ing very big strings.
	* Fixed memory leaks when running out of memory.
	* Fixed escaping/printing of nasty strings like
	  backslash + control char.
	* Fixed some redrawing glitches on very long input lines.
	  Input lines bigger than the whole window are still not drawn
	  correctly. Same problem on prompts longer than a line.
	* Fixed #prompts to fully work also on prompts received inside
	  a set of newline-terminated lines.
	* Documented #prompt, #capture and #movie to work only for
	  the main MUD connection
	  
Changes from 1.1.3 to 1.1.4 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 23 Jul 1998
	* Renamed `movie_play' to `movie'. Will do the replay if invoked as
	  `movie_play' and will convert to ASCII if invoked as `movie2ascii'
	* Fixed a 1.1.1 bug that could cause a lot of missed binds.
	* Finished adding ANSI prototypes. Renamed some files and remixed
	  some code in the process.
	* Removed -DUSE_TERMIO. If you used it, no problem.
	  If you didn't use it, you must now add -DUSE_SGTTY.
	* Fixed a few compiling problems on OSF1 and other systems
	  with really annoying compilers.
	* Fixed missing sig_oneshot on systems without SA_ONESHOT
	* Fixed input of chars with high bit set (again).
	
Changes from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 21 Jul 1998
	* Variable names are now expressions too. This means that
	  @("foo"+"bar") is the variable @foobar.
	* Added `just in time' substitution: ${varname} @{varname} and #{expr}
	  Not yet implemented for regexp patterns, sorry.
	  This introduces a subtle incompatibility with older versions,
	  as now also text coming from $n substitution gets unescaped.
	  Sorry again. (see powwow.doc for details).
	* #action and #prompt did not work when using an expression
	  as pattern. Now fixed.
	* Fixed small bug in anonymous actions. Someone still using them?
	* powwow_help renamed powwow.help
	* Fixed a bug in #alias: $1..$9 all contained the first word ($1)
	* Fixed math operators . : .? :? .< .> <. >. :< :> <: >: which
	  segfaulted on empty strings (bug introduced in 1.1.0)
	* Made SIGINT signal handler non-permanent to allow interrupting
	  system calls like connect(). Partially reverses the change in 0.9.3
	* Undone a change Gustav made in 0.9.3: now #connect with no args
	  always lists the open connections. To open a new connection you must
	  give at least one argument, for example #connect main.
	* Changed edit function &redraw-line not to clear prompt.
	  Use &redraw-line-noprompt to get the old behaviour.
	* Added #movie command to record all output from the MUD
	  and local commands to a file, adding timestamps to allow replay
	  at correct speed. Also added `movie_play' standalone program
	  to actually do the replay.

Changes from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 16 Jun 1998
	* The wildcard `$' now correctly matches single words only
	  both in #actions and in #marks.
	  It was (again!) matching also multiple words like `&'
	* Fixed up attr and noattr math operators, which broke in 1.1.0
	* Added workaround for buggy terminals which create empty lines with 
	  coloured background when using #hilite <whatever> on <colour>.
	  Must compile with -DBUG_ANSI to enable it.

Changes from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 11 Jun 1998
	* Added some changes from 1.0.1 that didn't go in 1.1.0.
	  The 1.0.x and the 1.1.x trees are indipendent...
	* Wrote a memmem() replacement for systems that don't have it.
	* Decreased CPU usage when receiving lots of text from the terminal
	  (for example using cut-n-paste)
	* Continued adding ANSI prototypes.	

Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 20 May 1998
	* Splitted 1.0.x and 1.1.x source trees.
	* Started adding ANSI function prototypes.
	  Old K&R compilers still work.
	* Removed all size limits in all strings, text lines and variables.
	  Also allowed '\0' (ASCII zero) in strings.
	  It was a _huge_ task! Probably messed up all and everything.
	* Side effect of the above: lines of arbitrary length received from
	  the MUD should now work perfectly (at least as long as you have
	  enough memory)

Changes from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 18 May 1998
	* Changed name of some files (Changelog, Hacking, Compile.how,
	  Config.demo)
	* Fixed #capture and #record to save text from main connection only.
	* Fixed a buffer overrun in $last_line when receiving lines longer
	  than 1024 chars. Hopefully lines up to 4095 chars will now work.
	* Fixed message "Creating %s" when creating a new definition file.
	* Added `catrw' standalone mini-program for splitting powwow output
	  in multiple windows (quick tutorial in powwow.doc, section #write)
	* Added #rebindall and #rebindALL

Changes from 0.9.9 to 1.0.0 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 13 May 1998
        * Disabled NAGLE for tcp connections (set TCP_NODELAY option)
	  which should hopefully increase performance during lossy conditions
	  (idea and code contributed by Finne Arne Gangstad)
	* Cleaned up error handling. Powwow tries really hard to report
	  any system call error, quitting only when there is really no hope.
	  Anyway, if you get a '#system call error' message, you should
	  seriously consider quitting as soon as possible since either
	  the connection is messed up or your system is running
	  out of resources.
	* Removed extra newline after prompt bug when in #option -compact mode,
	  introduced in 0.9.7
	* Fixed $last_line to contain last non-empty line from the MUD.
	* Updated config.demo with definitions for time-inside-prompt
	  and other things.

Changes from 0.9.8 to 0.9.9 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 12 May 1998
 	* Changed rx.h to regex.h in includes
	* Fixed behaviour on prompts and lines received in multiple packets:
	  0.9.7 and 0.9.8 sometimes print garbage.
	* Added some flush()es in the code to cope with the new
	  terminal I/O buffering.

Changes from 0.9.7 to 0.9.8 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 11 May 1998
	* Fixed compile problems on AIX (got out of sync).
	* Fixed a stupid bug that caused all actions to be regexp
	  (introduced in 0.9.7)
	* Introduced a more efficient terminal I/O buffering.

Changes from 0.9.6 to 0.9.7 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 11 May 1998
	* Increased stability when receiving extremely long lines (>1024 bytes)
	  The fix is only partial, powwow can still crash on lines slightly
	  shorter than 4096 bytes when a lot of #marks are used.
	* Cleaned up the names of various #defines
	  In particular, USETERMIO is now USE_TERMIO and
	  TELNETBUG is now BUG_TELNET
	* Added #option autoprint, to automatically print lines matched
	  by #actions.
	* Added #spawn command.
	* Added #prompt command. Just like #action, but matches both on
	  prompts and on normal text.
	* #actions now work differently on prompts:
	  prompts are not matched immediately against #actions,
	  but only after a \n arrives from the MUD, just in case they are
	  actually normal lines received in multiple packets and not prompts.
	  
	  Thanks to the this change, powwow behaves better on lines received
	  in two (or more) packets.
	  See the file powwow.doc, section `#prompt' for the gory details.

Changes from 0.9.5 to 0.9.6
                   (Gustav Hållberg, Massimiliano Ghilardi) 16 Oct 1997
	* Fixed a nasty security hole in MPI messages
	* Fixed handling of \; at the end of a command
	* Fixed some other problems:
	  short messages from MUD could interfere with remote editing,
	  #bind escape sequences containing \0 were incorrectly printed/saved

Changes from 0.9.4 to 0.9.5
                   (Gustav Hållberg, Massimiliano Ghilardi) 18 Sep 1997
	* Continued code cleanup
	* Allowed aliases starting with `#'
	* Removed #speedwalk, #info, #echo, #keyecho, #compact and #debug
	  and turned them into #options: `#option echo' and so on.
	  For compatibility, `#echo' is aliased to `#option echo' and so on.
	* Fixed a dangerous bug making cursor jump to start of typed text
	  when receiving a line that wraps. The bug appeared in 0.9.4,
	  so blame Gustav ;)
	* Fixed an old bug making powwow sometimes miss a bind
        * Made the command from a bound key appear with `#hilite' setting
        * Made a DEFAULT_HELP_DIR define in powwow.c
	* Changed to from ' ' to ` ' in some messages

Changes from 0.9.3 to 0.9.4 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 04 Sep 1997
	* Included all the huge changes made by Gustav Hållberg:
	  I really have no time to double-check them all.
	  If something works in 0.9.2 but is broken in 0.9.4,
	  you know who to bother :)
	* Small esthetic changes in the source, no effects on executable
	* Changed identifier for regexp #actions from ']' to '%'

Changes from 0.9.2 to 0.9.3 (Gustav Hållberg) 11 Aug 1997
	* Fixed so packets ending with \r*\n\r* set promptstr to ""
	* Made all signal handlers permanent (sig_permanent)
	* Debugged and reinstalled #option (it was commented out for some
	  obscure reason (Massimiliano: I never finished it...)),
	  allowing storage of command history and word 
	  completions in the savefile. Added the 'exit' option to allow
	  powwow to autoexit when the last connection closes
	* #echo, #info, #wrap and #debug now get saved in the savefile
	* Made repetitive use of &complete-word and &complete-line cycle 
	  through possible completions
	* Made a memory-safe strdup (called str_dup)
	* When starting a child viewer/editor, that process' TITLE 
	  environment variable is set to something appropriate (?)
	* Regular expressions (Extended POSIX regexp)
	  available for actions; uses GNU rx.
	* Actions with label "" forbidden
	* Added the #delim command to change word delimeter mode
	* Whenever main_conn changes permanently, linemode is set to 0 and
	  promptstr to ""
	* Fixed a crashy bug in the >: operator
	* Fixed the notorious extra-space-on-insert bug (both 'ic' and 'im'
	  shall NOT be sent if you want to insert something) and a VT100
	  mode bug while I was feeling creative
	* Made the local editing protocol respect prompts (i.e. they get
	  rewritten after protocol messages are shown). After texts are sent
	  back to the mud, the output buffer is flushed (no more pressing
	  ENTER after you've stopped editing!)
	* Fixed a few bugs in #mark; pattern "&" doesn't crash anymore.
	  Patterns with consecutive wildcards never worked, so I forbade them.
	  It could be implemented, but I hardly think it's worth it
	* Added the ANSIBUG compiler directive to fix the bug in some terms
	  that show new lines in the current output attrib (screws #mark e.g.)
	* Made '#connect' without parameters try to open a connection
	  titled 'main' to 'hostname' (if specified) if no conns are open.
	  The initstr from #init will be used in this case
	* Added &transpose-words, &upcase-word and &downcase-word (defaults
	  to M-t, M-u and M-l). Repetition of the latter two changes case
	  of the whole line
	* Changed default key names to be more emacs-like (C-b, Ret etc)
	* Made #host get written to the savefile iff *hostname != 0, and 
	  if powwow is started as 'powwow filename', without any #host in
	  the file, #init is ran immediately
	* Fixed a bug in cmd_print() that didn't cope with $0 not being set
	* Allowed \0 to be part of a bound key's escape sequence. New format
	  for #bind allows octal \012 be part of the string representation
	  of the esc seq (chars with high bit set get saved in octal now)
	* Made permanent variables $last_line and $prompt
	* Made "#var" without arguments list all defined named variables

Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.2 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 04 Jun 1997
	* Added #keyecho command toggle echo of bound keys.
	  Previously, this was controlled by the generic #echo command.
	* CTRL-C can now safely interrupt blocking commands like
	  #connect and #bind.
	* POWWOWDIR is now used correctly in all cases:
	  not only when starting powwow with a filename but also when using
	  #load, #save or #file
	* Changed #file syntax. Now you need = before the save-file.
	  Putting = alone undefines the save-file and disables autosave
	  when you quit.
	* Cleaned up naming conventions: 'session' means editing session
	  while 'connection' means remote host connection.
	* Fixed handling of 8 bit chars typed from keyboard
	* Fixed '#reset bind' which was not reloading cursor binds
	* Fixed remote host name spelling in files generated by #save.
	* Fixed a bug that caused powwow to crash when failing to
	  connect to a mud.

Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 31 Apr 1997
	* New connections opened with #connect are set as main connection.
	  You will have to switch back manually if you need it.
	* Cleaned up multiple connection support. Better error handling.
	* Cleaned up TELNETBUG support. I did not use it recently,
	  and was out of sync.
	* Enhanced #bind syntax: now you can specify control codes
	  sent by your keyboard directly from the command line.
	  As a side effect, #exe <file now works also on files created
	  with #save
	* Added #rebind command. Changes the control codes associated
	  to a key binding without changing its name or its effect.
	* Added #quit command.

Changes from 0.8.6 to 0.9.0 (Massimiliano Ghilardi) 29 Apr 1997
        * Added FreeBSD support in make_it (thanks to Jaako Knuutila)
        * Cleaned up terminal interface.
	* #save and #load now accept a filename as argument
	* Handle SIGQUIT as SIGINT: use to stop long or infinite loops
	* Now can switch main connection on the fly with ##<connection-name>
	* Allow powwow #commands also on subsidiary connections

Changes from 0.8.5 to 0.8.6 (Paolo Gatti, Massimiliano Ghilardi) 28 Apr 1997
        * Finally and definitively changed the name to powwow.
	  Previously, sometimes the program was referred to as pow-wow
	  and sometimes as powwow, generating confusion.
        * Partial port of powwow to AmigaDOS. Incomplete, will NOT compile.
	  Paolo abandoned the project, so maybe it will just never compile.
	* Fixed a bug causing extra new-lines on screen when powwow received
	  strange data sequences like ASCII codes 10 13
	  (on DOS, new-line is 13 10, while on UN*X is 10 only)
        * Fixed a bug in #mark not matching correctly the wildcard $
        * Powwow crashed #loading files containing empty lines. Fixed

Changes from 0.8.4 to 0.8.5 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* Fixed a bug introduced by updating files from cancan 2.6.0b sources
	  (happened in version 0.8.3): powwow was sendind TWO new-line chars
	  instead of one immediately after every password.

Changes from 0.8.3 to 0.8.4 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* Fixed (I hope definitively) an ancient bug:
	  some lines were sometimes printed twice or not printed at all.
	  It is still the bug that appeared in version 0.4...
	  The bug was almost fixed in version 0.8b but reintroduced in 0.8.3

Changes from 0.8b to 0.8.3 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* Slightly changed version numbering (0.8.3 instead of 0.8c)
	* #save and #load are now safe even in case of errors
	  (example: `disk full')
	* hitting a #bind-ed key now echoes the corresponding command
	  only if #echo is on
        * updated term.c (terminal handling code) and tel.c (telnet code)
	  with files from cancan 2.6.0b (yes, I shamelessly copied them)
	  No external changes anyway (unless I introduced some bugs)
          note: beam.c NOT updated/copied
        * 'follow' standalone mini-program added (see README.follow)
        * #key is now explicitly stated not to support editing keys.
	  They cannot be added cleanly without rewriting the line-editing code
	  from scratch ('#key up' and '#key return' give the biggest problems)
	  and I don't have the time for that right now
        * blink attribute added
        * Now can use multiple attributes in #mark, #hilite, #color
	  example: #mark *An Orc*=inverse bold blue on red
	  Note: bold, blink, underline and inverse must appear BEFORE colors
	* fixed some bugs:
	* changed "VERSION" to "POWWOW_VERSION" in powwow.c.
	  It seems some compilers use VERSION for internal purposes...
	* #wrap mode was discarding lines containing only escape sequences
	  (example: color codes coming from the MUD)
        * #hilite was restoring hilight attributes after EVERY line
	  coming from the MUD
	* self-recursive aliases were causing crash after 100 loops instead
	  of trapping error and reporting '#error: stack overflow'
	  (not always, and not on all OS). Now they are completely safe.
	  Note: they still eat 1MB of memory (10K per loop - released
	  immediately after)

Changes from 0.8a to 0.8b (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* hexadecimal numbers added (and in any other base)
	  can be used only from calculator, prefix is #
	* '#write' command added
	* fixed a bug with #nice affecting #load
	  now #load places actions/marks in memory in the same order as
	  config file, indipendently from #nice value.
	  Also, default #nice changes from 1 (top) to 0 (bottom)
	* fixed a bug in #save that sometimes caused crashes and destroyed
	  config file
	* now word completion (issued with TAB key) checks
	  word completion list _before_ built-in commands

Changes from 0.8 to 0.8a (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* remind me NEVER to work on Sunday, because I filled version 0.8 with
	  these bugs (now fixed):
	  - some debugging stuff was not deleted from official version
	  - deleting a named variable could cause a crash
	  - creating a named variable was giving a message even while reading
	    a definition file
	  - #settimer was not working due to a change in version 0.8
	  - forgot to say that #map variable was added
	* #rand, #map and #timer variables renamed rand, map and timer
	  (removed the #) - sorry for the change but it was necessary.
	* removed limit of 50 named variables of each kind (numeric and string)
	  now the only limit is the memory available

Changes from 0.7b to 0.8 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* #mark now accepts wildcards ($ for a single word, & for a string)
	* named variables are now supported
	* #assign renamed #var (I never liked the name 'assign' ...)
	  also, #var can be used to delete variables from memory
	* #nice command added. It sets/shows priority of new actions/marks

Changes from 0.7a to 0.7b (Finn Arne Gangstad)
        * make_it now also works for sunos 5.x, irix 5.x and hpux 9.x

Changes from 0.7 to 0.7a (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* fixed a _HUGE_ hole in security: $n in actions was matching also ;
	  (but not spaces) so robotic actions gave a chance to other players
	  to force you (*AAARGH*)
	* startup changed: now powwow does not clear screen when executed,
	  but jumps to the end of screen (this avoids mess in the first lines
	  you get from the mud)

Changes from 0.6d to 0.7 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* finally fixed the unpleasant bug of auto-wrap making confusion when
	  receiving lines that contain escape sequences
	  (the fix in 0.6d was far from satisfactory)
	* high-intensity colours added (for the terminals that support them)
	* #assign can be used to put the contents of a variable on input line
	* number of global variables raised to 50, max lenght of string
	  variables raised to 512 bytes
	* #settimer command added, '#time' variable changed into '#timer'
	* fixed a bug: math operator >= was wrong, worked as <=

Changes from 0.6c to 0.6d (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* break key now is also used to stop command-parsing. Useful to stop
	  long or infinite loops without exiting from powwow.
	* #stop command added. It disables all active delayed commands.
	* #mark now works also with prompts (was not implemented before)
	* fixed an ancient bug with #action not working on lines splitted into
	  multiple data packets by telnet.
	* fixed two other ancient bugs:
	  #mark not working on auto-wrapped words
	  and auto-wrap making confusion when receiving lines that contain
	  escape sequences (only partially fixed to be honest)
	* Now the unescaping is performed ALSO on quoted strings, when powwow
	  evaluates them. Thus there might be to update your definition file
	  if it contains escapes placed in strings.

Changes from 0.6b to 0.6c (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* If you have problems with #rand, random() and srandom() (typically
	  your compiler is unable to find the functions) you can define
	  NO_RANDOM at compile time. (temporary solution)
	* Now also editing keys can be redefined
	* #assign command added (same syntax of #print, #send and #exe)
	* Now you can specify start and end line of a file or output of Bourne
	  shell command when using #print, #send, #exe, #emulate or #assign
	* #debug command added (try it in test mode...)
	* Now #echo, #info, #speedwalk and #debug also accept 'on' or 'off'

Changes from 0.6 to 0.6b (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* #emulate command added (same syntax of #print, #send and #exe)
	* now also prompts can be intercepted by #actions
	  (but cannot be 'gagged')
	* powwow can run in test-mode without being connected to a MUD

Changes from 0.5 to 0.6 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* more debug work
	* #exe, #send and #print extended to use shell commands and files
	  Also, #send replaces #read
	* #time variable added
	* #rand function added
	* #connect now supports a different remote host for each connection
	  (i.e. you can now play on different MUDs with the same invocation
	  of powwow)

	Ideas coming from Cancan 2.5.1c and implemented on powwow 0.6:

	* output to the remote host is buffered up and sent all at once in the
	  main loop, to reduce the number of network packets. Long aliases
	  might benefit from this, as would repeated commands (#10 buy bread).
	* #help now works on commands. A help file is needed and provided.
	* new command: #record, records lines you type in a file
	* source changed so path for helpfile is taken from environment
	  variable POWWOWHELP (if this variable is not defined, powwow looks
	  in current directory)
	* to print the message of the day, must define MOTDFILE in compiling
	  with the name (and complete path) of the file containing the message
	* Now compiles on BSD/386 as well, automatically detected by make_it

Changes from 0.4 to 0.5 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* Heavy debug work, since 0.4 was an alpha version
	  (it is not a good idea to place here the huge list of bugs fixed...)
	* added #history to list/execute commands in history
	  Note: #history commands are not placed in history...
	* now internal commands can be abbreviated, for example #al can be used
	  istead of #alias. However, internal commands are still completed
	  using TAB

Changes from Cancan 2.5.0b to powwow 0.4 (Massimiliano Ghilardi)
	* Inline calculator, with both global and local variables, and C-like
	  syntax
	* added commands #(), #print, #send, #exe to use inline calculator
	* added commands #if-#else, #for and #while.
	* added #key, #save, #load, #save, #lines, #info, #echo, #compact, 
	  #net, #clock, #time
	* added #in and #at to define/edit delayed commands
	* #mark and all attrib-related commands now accept also the attribute
	  'none'
	* #marks and #actions now are not automatically sorted (to sort them,
	  define SORT in compiling). #aliases and #binds instead are always
	  sorted.
	* #aliases can be self-recursive now (it is potentially dangerous,
	  powwow will not enter a very long - but not infinite - loop)
	* Must not escape ';' anymore to place multiple commands in #alias,
	  #action or #bind. Instead, multiple commands must be surrounded by
	  braces, { and }
	* #action changed syntax (not need double quotes anymore, but need one
	  of > < + - = before label) See powwow.doc for details
	  Lines matched with #action are not printed on screen automatically,
	  must use a #print to echo them
	* #gag is suppressed (not needed anymore), and #add is now a command
	* Escaping technique changed. Now unescaping '\\\#' gives '\\#' (i.e.
	  remove one \ each time), and you can also escape \, in this way:
	  \` gives \ alone, \`` gives \` and so on. So for example, if you
	  want to place a \ at the end of an #action pattern, you must write
	  \` , to avoid escaping the = after the pattern
	* Some bugs of Cancan fixed (small things, expecially wrapping)

Changes from 2.5.0a to 2.5.0b (Finn Arne Gangstad)
	* Fixed bug with client aborting when window was resized.

Changes from 2.5.0 to 2.5.0a (Finn Arne Gangstad)
	* Various tweaks to make it compile on most systems.

Changes from 2.4.4 to 2.5.0 (Mattias Engdegård)
	* the length of the prompt is now correctly calculated
	  even if it contains escape sequences (for muds with coloured prompt).
	* built-in commands are always completed with tab and aren't stored in
	  the word list
	* #hilite and #mark now accept general attributes: ansi colours and
	  bold, underline, inverse.
	* the #action command has changed syntax; now double quotes are
	  required around the pattern, but they can be named. Actions can be
	  turned on and off.
	* the keydefs list contains all keyboard bindings. The #bind command
	  can define new keys.
	* the #alias, #action, #bind and #mark commands can now put a
	  definition line in the input buffer for easy editing.
	  The keys M-p and M-n are no longer used.
	* some new files, new source module discipline with external
	  declarations only in header files.
	* added the file `Hacking' with some advice.
	* mapping functions cleaned up. #map now displays ssss as 4s.
	* the definition file is tagged with a file version, to make it easier
	  to recognize older save formats.
	* cancan now displays a motd file whose location is set at compile
